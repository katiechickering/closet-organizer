## ℹ️ Overview

This project was built with a Node.js and Express backend and a React frontend styled with Tailwind CSS. Created with an MVC structure, this app uses MongoDB for the model, an Express API as the controller, and React for the view. The clothing item feature provides full CRUD functionality. We implemented login and registration using JSON Web Tokens stored in browser cookies for authentication. We noticed the inefficiency and inconvenience of physically going through tons of clothes and accessories. We created a better solution by being able to have access to your entire closet in the palm of your hand.


## 🚀 Deployment

To deploy our application, we used Render for the backend server and Vercel for the frontend React application. Both services are connected to our GitHub monorepo and automatically update whenever changes are pushed to the repository. Render routes to our `server` folder, while Vercel routes to our `client` folder. We have included .env.example files in both our `client` and `server` folders to show how the environment variables are set up. To host our database, we used MongoDB Atlas.
